    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Malloo Knits is a crochet and knitting blog. They post different patterns for those who crochet, knit, or are just beginning to learn one of those. 
    Malloo Knits also has resources on the website for those who want to start their own blog. 
    Some of the weaknesses I noticed right away on the website was that the logo or name of the site wasn’t visible when the home page is first opened up on desktop. 
    Other weakness I noticed was that they had a lot of pictures everywhere which caused users to struggle to find what they were looking for on the pages and could also easily distract them from their task. 
    The website also didn’t have a page for all the patterns which makes it difficult to navigate to the pattern that the users want.</p>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>One of the goals I had for this redesign was to restructure the home page. This included reducing the amount of images and putting the logo at the top so it could be seen when the home page is first opened.
        Another goal was to create a page for teh patterns. This would make it easier for users to find them.

    <h2>Research</h2>

    <p>The website appeals to those who crochet, knit or want to learn. It can also appeal to those who are looking to start their own blog through the resources the site posts. 
        A user persona was created to reflect this target audience. Then four Individuals who fit the target audience participated in a card sort exercise. Overall it produced similar results. 
        The results received from this card sort influenced the decisions made when redesigning the site map of the website.</p>
