<h1>Malloo Knits - User Interface Design Project</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Malloo Knits is a crochet and knitting blog. They post different patterns for those who crochet, knit, or are just beginning to learn one of those. 
Malloo Knits also has resources on the website for those who want to start their own blog. 
Some of the weaknesses I noticed right away on the website was that the logo or name of the site wasn’t visible when the home page is first opened up on desktop. 
Other weakness I noticed was that they had a lot of pictures everywhere which caused users to struggle to find what they were looking for on the pages and could also easily distract them from their task. 
The website also didn’t have a page for all the patterns which makes it difficult to navigate to the pattern that the users want.</p>
