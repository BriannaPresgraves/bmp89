    <h1>Lantern Fly Trap - Design Thinking in Product Design Project</h1>
    <h2>Intoduction</h2>
        <p>For this project, we were divided into teams where we had to pick an issue that we wanted to design an interface and prototype for. Including myself I was a part of a group of three and we chose to create a product to solve the lantern fly problem. Our problem statement was that lantern flies were infesting Philadelphia and the surrounding areas and we need a way to capture and kill the invasive creatures without intruding on the city.</p>
